- [x] Create nodes view - a page to show all nodes in the mesh - with ability to filter and sort the nodes, - should be done in same arch as evnets/logs - nodes in the list should be taged
- [x] Modify node page:
  - Add ability to sort nodes by multiple predicates:
    - distance
    - rssi
    - last seen
    - channel
    - role
    - name
  - Display last seen time in human readable format

  - Update nodes to also contain source node name
  - Update nodes filtering to be also possible by node name 
- [x] Create chatting widget that will allow to send messages to devices and display them in the list
  - Chat view should be scrollable and has a input component at the bottom
  - Input should accept rich text - with emojis
  - Messages should be displayed in chronological order
  - Input should have a send button
  - Input should allow a size limit - by computing message size in bytes and comparing it to the limit
  - Current size should be shown and color of it should be updated based on the limit (green, yellow, red)
- [ ] On node connection - remember it so next time we can connect to it without a need to look for it on the list 
- [ ] All the app data like chats, node lists - should be kept in the app db - use drift 2.29.0 for it
- [ ] Investigate /Users/romanbartusiak/git/meshtastic-python for IP based communication - abstract away meshtastic communication logic and allow to use it for both IP/BLE/USB
